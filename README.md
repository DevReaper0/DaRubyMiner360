## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm *DevReaper0*, a student programmer who has been writing code since early 2019 and currently knows a variety of different programming languages. I also dabble a bit in creating digital art and music.

My current main projects:
- *[Cloud](https://github.com/CloudLoaderMC/CloudLoader)*, a hybrid mod loader for Minecraft aiming to actively support as many other loaders' mods as possible
- *[Libra](https://github.com/DevReaper0/libra)*, a new, open, and extensible music service.

Some other cool projects:
- *[ParaCode](https://github.com/ParaCodeLang/ParaCode)*, a prototypical programming language with a knack for extensibility
- *[Spirit](https://gitlab.com/DevReaper0/SpiritEngine)*, a simple, lightweight 2D OpenGL game engine
- *[Lockdown Mode](https://github.com/DevReaper0/GNOME-LockdownMode)*, a simple GNOME extension that makes it easy to unintrusively disallow specific apps
- *[CookieClicker++](https://github.com/DevReaper0/CookieClickerPlusPlus)*, a way to load Cookie Clicker but store saves in the cloud
- *[NewOS](https://github.com/DevReaper0/NewOS)*, a barebones operating system

I know a larger variety of languages, but these are my absolute favorites:
- *Rust*
- *Go*
- *Python*
- *Lua*
