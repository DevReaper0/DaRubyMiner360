### I'm *DevReaper0*, a student programmer who knows many different programming languages. I am also a digital artist and composer.

I'm currently working on:
- *[Cloud](https://github.com/CloudLoaderMC/CloudLoader)*, a hybrid mod loader for Minecraft aiming to actively support as many other loaders' mods as possible
- *[ParaCode](https://github.com/ParaCodeLang/ParaCode)*, a prototypical programming language with a knack for extensibility
- *[Spirit](https://gitlab.com/DevReaper0/SpiritEngine)*, a simple, lightweight 2D OpenGL game engine
- *[InstallLib](https://github.com/DevReaper0/InstallLib)*, a lightweight library to create cross-platform installer applications at no cost
- *[Lockdown Mode](https://github.com/DevReaper0/GNOME-LockdownMode)*, a simple GNOME extension that makes it easy to unintrusively disallow specific apps (to help me focus)
- *[CookieClicker++](https://github.com/DevReaper0/CookieClickerPlusPlus)*, a way to load Cookie Clicker but store saves in the cloud
- Many on-and-off side projects like [an unnamed barebones operating system](https://github.com/DevReaper0/NewOS), a game idea generator, and a few video game mods

The languages I know very well and commonly use (in no particular order):
- *Java*
- *C#*
- *C++*
- *C*
- *Python*
- *Lua*
- *Go*
- *JavaScript*
- *PHP*
- *Bash*
- *Rust*
- *Dart*
- *ParaCode* (yes, that's mine, but it still counts)
