### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm *DaRubyMiner360*, and I'm a student programmer and artist that knows 11 different programming languages.

I'm currently working on:
- *[Cloud](https://github.com/CloudLoaderMC/CloudLoader)*, a hybrid mod loader for Minecraft aiming to actively support as many other loaders' mods as possible
- *[ParaCode](https://github.com/ParaCodeLang/ParaCode)*, a prototypical programming language with a knack for extensibility
- *[Spirit](https://gitlab.com/DaRubyMiner360/SpiritEngine)*, a simple, lightweight 2D OpenGL game engine
- *[InstallLib](https://github.com/DaRubyMiner360/InstallLib)*, a lightweight library to create cross-platform installer applications at no cost
- Many on-and-off side projects like [an unnamed barebones operating system](https://github.com/DaRubyMiner360/NewOS), a game idea generator, and a few video game mods
